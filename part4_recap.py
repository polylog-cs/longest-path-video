        # example, for this node the answer would be … Your algorithm should be
        # faster than if you compute it for each node separately. The answer is
        # in the video description.

        # Also, the idea behind our algorithm can help you if you want to find
        # the diameter of a general network, like this one in the picture. If
        # you are interested in the details, which are pretty cool but beyond
        # the scope of this video, you can find more in the video description.
